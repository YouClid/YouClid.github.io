### Goals
We have been tasked with creating a markup language that can express geometric relationships in text.
Then, this language would be used to generate interactive geometric figures.
The first application of this project would be to create interactive parts of Euclid's Elements, with the hope that we can apply our markup language to other geometric texts.
