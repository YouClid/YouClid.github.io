### Future Plans
While specifying the exact coordinates for each point in the marked-up text seems to be working well, we ideally want a more elegant solution that can generate the points from the constraints implied by the text. Designing an algorithm that can accomplish that objective is therefore a long term goal for the backend that we will continue to work on. In addition to that, we want to faciliate a step-by-step generation of the diagrams in the text to illustrate the process of constructing the proofs in the propositions. One possible way to accomplish this might be to pass an array of array of objects to the frontend, where each array of objects will correspond to the objects that need to be generated in each step of the construction. Accomplishing this objective is the immediate short term goal for the backend team, and we hope to get this working by the end of next week.
